# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Mini-Exercises
This repository contains my laboratory exercises for CS123 (Data Structures). It includes hands-on implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

## Lab Exericises Description

Lab 1 – Arrays (Cinema Management System):
Simulates a cinema system using 1D and 2D arrays. Includes managing a student waitlist and seating chart with insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations.

Lab 2 – Singly Linked List (Clinic Queue System):
Simulates a clinic queue using a singly linked list. Covers inserting, deleting, searching, and traversing nodes while understanding head and tail pointers.
